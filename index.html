            <p class="paragraph">Abu Hurairah (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Whoever relieves a
                Muslim of a burden
                from the burdens of the world, Allah will relieve him of a burden from the burdens on the Day of
                Judgement. And whoever helps ease a difficulty in the world, Allah will grant him ease from a difficulty
                in the world and in the Hereafter. And whoever covers (the faults of) a Muslim, Allah will cover (his
                faults) for him in the world and the Hereafter. And Allah is engaged in helping the worshipper as long
                as the worshipper is engaged in helping his brother.”

                Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1930, Book 27, Hadith 36</p>

                said, “The Muslim is a brother to another Muslim. He does not wrong him, nor surrender him. Whoever
                fulfills the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs."</p>
